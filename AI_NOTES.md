This project utilized an AI assistant at various points to help speed up development and improve code quality. The following tasks were assisted by AI:

Writing tests – Generated initial Jest tests for API endpoints and utility functions.

Creating validations – Assisted in writing input validation for API requests (e.g., checking required fields, types).

Deploying to Render – Guidance on setting up the project on Render and configuring environment variables.

CI/CD workflow – Helped create the GitHub Actions workflow to run lint, tests, build, and deploy.

Documentation & README – Suggestions for formatting README, project structure, and instructions for setup.

Reflection:
AI was useful in quickly generating boilerplate code and providing examples for tests, validation, deployment, and CI/CD. In most cases, the generated code required manual review and minor adjustments to integrate properly with the project. Overall, AI helped save time and reduce repetitive work while ensuring best practices were followed.
